Dr. Brand, 

I hope this note finds you well. I've managed to seal you off from the rest of the lab
while you recover from your injuries. I'm sure you understand why I had no other choice.

It seems Richards has reset the security systems, so your old I.D. won't do you any good anymore. 
To get around you'll have to use my prototype Chroma Collapser that I've left you. 
It's missing a few chips, but if you're lucky you might be able to find some spares lying around. 

Take care of yourself Dr. Brand. I'll see you along the way. I'm going to try and talk some sense
into Richards.
