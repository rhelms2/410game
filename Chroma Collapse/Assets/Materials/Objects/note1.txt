Hey bud, it's me. You're probably wondering what's going on. Don't worry 
too much! You'll find out in time... though I'll be the first to admit 
I'm still figuring things out myself. 

That red door ahead is a bit stuck. You can color me surprised if you manage
to pry that thing open without some sort of extra gizmo. Best to retrace
your steps.

Anyhow, I'll see you along the way. Hope you're not too dizzy right now, 
the journey here can be quite a shock to the system!
