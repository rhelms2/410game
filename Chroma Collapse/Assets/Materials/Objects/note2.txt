Test: W02

The resonant frequency scanner seems to confirm what we thought -
human beings hold the same color potential as any color sensitive
inanimate object. Test L05 showed promise in isolating resonant
frequency 01 ("red") in subjects 12 and 43. The results don't 
seem to last long, however - without extreme genetic intervention,
subjects phase through, just as the objects studied in test A03.

I see no other way to continue than to use genetic intervention to
bring out color sensitive properties in our subjects. With enough
testing, we may be able to extrapolate to unaltered human beings.
