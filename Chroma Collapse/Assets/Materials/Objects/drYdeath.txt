I'm sorry Brand... I've failed you. It won't be long now until I succumb to my wounds. 

I've left you what is possibly my greatest invention. It works just like the Chroma Collapser, only in
reverse. I suspect you'll get the hang of it pretty fast - however, I wasn't able to complete it. 
I've hidden chips around the laboratory that unlock the weapon's full potential. I trust you'll find
them before he does. 

You alone have the power to end this nightmare. The world is in your hands, Brand. Don't drop it.

Your friend,
Y
