Get all singletons working in DontDestroyOnLoad. There should be a single instance
loaded of the following prefabs:

GameManager
Player
Display and HUD

After this, test this by adding scene transitions. Scene transitions should manage
the player object through the singleton instance of the game manager. 

Add a fade in/fade out to the scene transition. 

Add a frozen state to the player that the scene transition uses.

After this is working, rewrite the player health script so that it is connected
to the game manager. Implement and test respawning based on health.

Once this is all working, start making the goonber enemy.

08/06/24

All singletons are working in DontDestroyOnLoad
Scene transitions are very close to working with a frozen state for the player

8/07/24

The features mentioned above in 8/06 are functional (they don't look amazing but we can come back to it). Moving on to:

Redo the player health and game over/respawning system

Redo the inventory system, keep in mind how a rudimentary save system would work

8/10/24

Respawns are implemented and the inventory system is revamped. Moving on to:

Game over screen - prompts player to restart or quit

Quick respawns (This won't trigger the game over screen and just respawns the player in the same scene)

Here are some other things that also need to be tackled:

Change the player's orientation based on spawn/respawn when setting the transform position	- Attempted

Add appropriate screen flash and sound effect for health changes?

Make sure changing the player state to freeze also locks the camera - Good

8/19/24

Fix game over screen input glitch. Add functionality to either click the button with the mouse OR select with the up/down buttons and press the activate key to click the button. - DONE

Once this is working consistently, start working on goonbers.
